# Exercise 1 : 1.5

Plotting Life Expectancy  vs GDP per Capita in Canada

```r
gapminder %>%
  select (country,gdpPercap,lifeExp) %>%
  filter (country=='Canada') %>%
  ggplot(aes(lifeExp,gdpPercap)) +  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +

ggtitle("Life Expectancy vs GDP per capita in Canada")
```

# Exercise 2:

Continuous variables= gdpPercap

Discrete Variable= continent

### Possible Values for continent:

```r
summary(gapminder$continent)
```

```
##   Africa Americas     Asia   Europe  Oceania 
##      624      300      396      360       24
```

### Distribution of Continents:
Number of observations for each continent in the gapminder dataset

```r
gapminder %>%
  ggplot( aes(continent)) + geom_bar() +ylab("Count")+xlab("Continent")+ggtitle("Distribution of Observations in Gapminder Data Set by Continent")
```

![](hw_02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->


### Possible Values for gdpPercap

```r
summary(gapminder$gdpPercap)  
```

```
##     Min.  1st Qu.   Median     Mean  3rd Qu.     Max. 
##    241.2   1202.1   3531.8   7215.3   9325.5 113523.1
```
### Mean Value for gdpPercap

```r
mean(gapminder$gdpPercap)  
```

```
## [1] 7215.327
```

### Standard Deviation of gdpPercap

```r
sd(gapminder$gdpPercap)
```

```
## [1] 9857.455
```

### Spread of GDP per capita values by continent:
The spread of GDP per cpita values for each continent in the Gapminder dataset

```r
boxplot(gdpPercap~continent,data=gapminder, main="Boxplots of Gapminder GDP per Capita by Continent", 
    xlab= "Continent", ylab="GDP per Capita")
```

![](hw_02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)<!-- -->

### Distribution of GDP Per Capita

Histogram of the distribution of gdpPercap in the gapminder dataset

```r
gapminder %>%
  drop_na() %>%
ggplot() + geom_histogram( mapping=aes(gdpPercap)) + ylab("Count") + 
  xlab("GDP per Capita") + ggtitle("Histogram of GDP per Capita Value Distribution")
```

# Exercise 3: Plotting the Air Quality Dataset

The airquality dataset can be loaded from the package datasets using the following code:


```r
datasets::airquality
```

### Scatter plot of  Mean Ozone levels vs Temperature(°C) in airquality dataset

```r
airquality %>%
  filter(!is.na(Month) & !is.na(Ozone))%>%
ggplot(aes(Ozone,Temp)) + geom_point(alpha=0.5) +  scale_x_continuous("Ozone (ppb)") +
theme_bw() + ylab("Temperature (°C)") + ggtitle("Mean Ozone (ppb) vs Temperature(°C)")
```

![](hw_02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)<!-- -->

### Histogram of Air quality data set

```r
airquality %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  ggplot() + aes(Ozone)+ geom_histogram()+ggtitle("")
```

![](hw_02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)<!-- -->


### Bonus
The code described in the assignment does not achieve the desired result.
It returns only half the entries needed. 
It skips every second entry for Rwanda and every first for Afghanistan.
This is because the filter function was looking for Rwanda and Afghanistan together and not first for all the entries of Rwanda and then all the entries of Afghanistan
That is, it recycles the c("Rwanda","Afghanistan") vector. 
It looks for Rwanda, then Afghanistan, then Rwanda and so on.Rather than for Rwanda or Afghanistan.

Corrected Version:


```r
gapminder %>%
  filter( country == "Rwanda"| country== "Afghanistan") %>%
  DT::datatable()
```
